# Redux Store(front)

An e-commerce application that uses [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) as the primary state container and [MUI](https://mui.com/) as the main source for UI components.

The application will feature products pulled from a live API, product detail pages, and a mocked checkout flow.

From a developer standpoint, here are some of my goals in building this project -

- Build competency in many of the features of Redux, such as global, event-first state management.
- Understand and implement as many of Redux's [best practices](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/) as possible.
- Practice creating a responsive, accessible, and attractive UX/UI.
- Prioritize maintainable, scalable, and modular architecture in all parts of the application.

_Note: This application does not provide any actual transaction functionality and none of the products listed are available for purchase. At least, not from me._
